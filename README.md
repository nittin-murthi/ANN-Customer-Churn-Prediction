# ANN-Customer-Churn-Prediction
Deep Learning model using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to predict customer churn for a relecommunications firm. The model predicts whether a customer will stay or churn for a telecommunications company using data from Q2 2023. The model uses TensorFlow 2.0 and Keras. There are two ANNs that were trained and tested for higher accuracy. The first ANN contains three layers and uses dropout and regularization techniques. the second ANN contains 7 layers and uses dropout and regularization techniques as well. the first model has a mean classification accuracy of 81.1% and the second one had a mean classification accuracy of 76.7%. The model uses the following features to predict: 

gender

Whether the customer has dependents or not (Yes, No)

Number of months the customer has stayed with the company

PhoneService

Whether the customer has a phone service or not (Yes, No)
